          We challenged ourselves to create a visual language for our users that
          synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the innovation
          and possibility of technology and science. This is material design.
          This spec is a living document that will be updated as we continue to
          develop the tenets and specifics of material design.

            <h2>Material is the metaphor</h2>
            <p>
              A material metaphor is the unifying theory of a rationalized space
              and a system of motion. The material is grounded in tactile
              reality, inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet
              technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span>
            <p>
              Surfaces and edges of the material provide visual cues that are
              grounded in reality. The use of familiar tactile attributes helps
              users quickly understand affordances. Yet the flexibility of the
              material creates new affordances that supersede those in the
              physical world, without breaking the rules of physics.
            </p>
          </span>
          <p>
            The fundamentals of light, surface, and movement are key to
            conveying how objects move, interact, and exist in space and in
            relation to each other. Realistic lighting shows seams, divides
            space, and indicates moving parts.

            <h2>Bold, graphic, intentional</h2>
            <p>
              Bold, graphic, intentional The foundational elements of
              print-based design – typography, grids, space, scale, color, and
              use of imagery – guide visual treatments. These elements do far
              more than please the eye. They create hierarchy, meaning, and
              focus.
            </p>
          </span>
          <span>
            <p>
              Deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale
              typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic
              interface that immerse the user in the experience.

              An emphasis on user actions makes core functionality immediately
              apparent and provides waypoints for the user.

          <span>
            <h2>Motion provides meaning</h2>
            <p>
              Motion respects and reinforces the user as the prime mover.
              Primary user actions are inflection points that initiate motion,
              transforming the whole design.
            </p>
          </span>
          <p>
            All action takes place in a single environment. Objects are
            presented to the user without breaking the continuity of experience
            even as they transform and reorganize.
          </p>
          <p>
            Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and
            maintain continuity. Feedback is subtle yet clear. Transitions are
            efﬁcient yet coherent.
